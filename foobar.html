		<h1>The Foo Bar Table</h1>
		<p>Legends tell of a certain type of foo that preys on numbers that are divisible by 3.
		Such legends also tell of a similar type of bar, which only hunts numbers that are divisible by 5.
		It is also said that, on the occasion that a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the foo and bar shall combine into a great new word.
		But that is just myth. Or so we thought...</p>
		<p>This table seeks to prove the existence of these elusive foos and bars. 
		The left column is a sterile list of incrementing numbers. 
		The right column also contains incrementing numbers, but these are vulnerable
		to any devious foos and bars. Use the buttons to print a new entry of each, 
		or to restart the experiment.</p>
